# Discrete Fourier transform visualization


"Discrete Fourier transform visualization" is Java project that is based on Fourier series formula. This program converts the coordinates of the points that create a path
to an epicycle that recreates the path using circles.

# Features
Control of:
  - maximum number of cicles on screen
  - drawing speed
  - choosing path from builed in paths
  - choosing path from a txt file
  - creating path using mouse
